    This API specification contains information around the Feedback 360 Survey
    API developed by the App Dev Practice.

    The Feedback 360 Survey API enables the management of feedback surveys for
    customer engagements. A feedback survey is N/A to 5 point scale of competency around
    the technologies used for a project. Each added employee will be able to enhance the
    survey by adding technologies, softskills, and freetext for each of his or her
    colleagues. The will enable Red Hat to better understand multiple aspects of
    a consultant's skillset.
